## 4. Strategic Roadmap & Future Improvements

### Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The goal of this phase is to transition from a single-device prototype to a true, multi-device web application.

*   **User Authentication:**
    *   Implement sign-up, login, and password-reset flows.
    *   Support both email/password and social logins (e.g., Google).
*   **Backend & Cloud Database:**
    *   Integrate a Backend-as-a-Service (e.g., Firebase, Supabase).
    *   Migrate all data from `localStorage` to a cloud database (e.g., Firestore, PostgreSQL).
    *   All data will be tied to a user account.
*   **Cross-Device Sync:** Data will automatically sync in real-time across all devices a user is logged into.
*   **Settings Page:**
    *   User profile management (name, email, password).
    *   Application preferences (e.g., default view, theme selection, notification settings).

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

With the MVP infrastructure in place, this phase focuses on adding high-value features that enhance the core experience.

*   **Recurring Events:** Allow users to set tasks and events to repeat daily, weekly, or on custom schedules.
*   **Global Search:** Implement a powerful search bar to quickly find any task, class, or note across the entire app.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Scheduling:** Enhance the Timetable and Calendar views by allowing users to drag events to reschedule them.
*   **File Attachments:** Allow users to attach files (e.g., syllabi, assignment prompts, lecture notes) to tasks and subjects.

### Phase 4: Production Readiness & Polish

This phase is about ensuring the application is robust, reliable, and ready for a public launch.

*   **Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   **Unit & Integration Tests:** Use Jest and React Testing Library to ensure individual components and features work correctly.
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Use Cypress or Playwright to automate user journeys and catch regressions.
*   **DevOps & Deployment:**
    *   Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.
    *   Integrate an error monitoring service (e.g., Sentry) to track and fix bugs in production.
*   **Analytics:** Integrate analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) to understand user behavior, track feature adoption, and make data-driven decisions.

## 5. Success Metrics

The success of School Planner Pro will be measured by:

*   **User Engagement:** Daily Active Users (DAU) and Monthly Active Users (MAU).
*   **User Retention:** Percentage of users who return to the app weekly/monthly.
